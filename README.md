# Damage-detection-using-deep-learning

This is an implementation of a damage detection in steel pipe (for more info, refer the report) which detects damage using pre-trained RESNET50 model trained on ultrasonic images containing the subsurface damage. Detecting damage in the sub-surface is a challenging task where deep learning and computer vision techniques can play a significant part.

Datasets used: The data used in our research work was taken from [1] where phased-array ultrasonic was used in the detection of flaws in a butt-weld in an austenitic 316L stainless steel pipe.

## Recommended System Requirements to train model

A good CPU and a GPU with atleast 8GB memory Atleast 8GB of RAM Active internet connection so that keras can download RESNET50 model weights.

## Required libraries for Python

- Python
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
