# Damage-detection-using-deep-learning

This is an implementation of a damage detection in steel pipe (for more info, refer the report) which detects damage using pre-trained RESNET50 model trained on ultrasonic images containing the subsurface damage. Detecting damage in the sub-surface is a challenging task where deep learning can and computer vision techniques can play a significant part.
